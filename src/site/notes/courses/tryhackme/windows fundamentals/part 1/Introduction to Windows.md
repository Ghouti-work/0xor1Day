The Windows operating system (OS) is a complex product with many system files, utilities, settings, features, etc.   

This module will attempt to provide a general overview of just a handful of what makes up the Windows OS, navigate the user interface, make changes to the system, etc. The content is aimed at those who wish to understand and use the Windows OS on a more comfortable level.
